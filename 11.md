 ### Chapter 12: Advanced Transformational Grammar Concepts

In this chapter, we will explore advanced transformational grammar concepts, including reduction, inversion, and other complex grammatical transformations. Understanding these advanced transformations will help you analyze more intricate syntactic structures and improve your grammatical proficiency.

#### 12.1 Reduction

Reduction involves the shortening of clauses while retaining their essential meaning. Common types of reduction include participial reduction, infinitive reduction, and relative clause reduction.

**Participial Reduction**

A participial reduction occurs when a relative clause is reduced to a participial phrase.

**Example:**
- Full: The man who is standing there is my friend.
- Reduced: The man standing there is my friend.

**Drawing Trees for Participial Reduction:**

Let's analyze the sentence "The man standing there is my friend."

```
               S
              / \
            NP   VP
          / | \    \
       Det  N  PartP  V  NP
       |    |     \   |   \
      The  man   standing  there  is  NP
                                      / \
                                    Det  N
                                    |    \
                                   my  friend
```

**Infinitive Reduction**

An infinitive reduction involves reducing a clause to an infinitive phrase.

**Example:**
- Full: She is the person who is to complete the task.
- Reduced: She is the person to complete the task.

**Drawing Trees for Infinitive Reduction:**

Let's analyze the sentence "She is the person to complete the task."

```
               S
              / \
            NP   VP
            |    / \
           Pro  V  NP
            |   |  / \
           She is  Det  N  InfP
                      |   \    \
                     the person  to complete the task
```

**Relative Clause Reduction**

A relative clause can be reduced by omitting the relative pronoun and verb, resulting in a noun phrase with an embedded participial phrase or prepositional phrase.

**Example:**
- Full: The book that is on the table is mine.
- Reduced: The book on the table is mine.

**Drawing Trees for Relative Clause Reduction:**

Let's analyze the sentence "The book on the table is mine."

```
               S
              / \
            NP   VP
          / | \    \
       Det  N   PP  V  NP
       |    |   / \  |   \
      The  book  P  NP  is  Pro
                 |   / \     |
                on  Det  N  mine
                    |    \
                   the  table
```

#### 12.2 Inversion

Inversion involves changing the normal word order of a sentence. Common types of inversion include subject-auxiliary inversion and subject-verb inversion.

**Subject-Auxiliary Inversion**

Subject-auxiliary inversion occurs in questions and certain conditional sentences.

**Example:**
- Statement: She is coming.
- Question: Is she coming?

**Drawing Trees for Subject-Auxiliary Inversion:**

Let's analyze the question "Is she coming?"

```
        S
       / \
      Aux  NP  VP
      |    |   \
     Is   Pro  V
           |   \
          she coming
```

**Subject-Verb Inversion**

Subject-verb inversion occurs in sentences beginning with negative adverbs or after certain expressions.

**Example:**
- Standard: She seldom visits.
- Inverted: Seldom does she visit.

**Drawing Trees for Subject-Verb Inversion:**

Let's analyze the sentence "Seldom does she visit."

```
        S
       / \
      AdvP  AuxP
      |    / \
   Seldom Aux  NP  VP
            |   |   \
           does Pro  V
                |   \
               she visit
```

#### 12.3 Extraposition

Extraposition involves moving an element of the sentence to the end for emphasis or clarity, often using "it" as a placeholder.

**Example:**
- Standard: That she won the prize is surprising.
- Extraposed: It is surprising that she won the prize.

**Drawing Trees for Extraposition:**

Let's analyze the sentence "It is surprising that she won the prize."

```
                 S
                / \
              NP   VP
              |    / \
             Pro  V  AdjP
              |   |  / \
             It is  Adj SBAR
                      |   \
                  surprising  S
                              / \
                            Conj  S
                            |     \
                          that   NP  VP
                                  |   / \
                                 Pro  V  NP
                                  |   |   \
                                 she  won  Det  N
                                          |   \
                                         the prize
```

#### 12.4 Pseudo-Cleft and Cleft Sentences

Pseudo-cleft and cleft sentences are used to highlight specific parts of a sentence.

**Pseudo-Cleft Sentences**

A pseudo-cleft sentence uses a wh-clause to emphasize a particular part of the sentence.

**Example:**
- Standard: She wants a new car.
- Pseudo-Cleft: What she wants is a new car.

**Drawing Trees for Pseudo-Cleft Sentences:**

Let's analyze the sentence "What she wants is a new car."

```
               S
              / \
           NP   VP
           |    / \
          NP  V  NP
         / \   |   \
       Pro VP is  Det N
       |   / \     |   \
      What Pro  V   a  new car
            |   |
           she wants
```

**Cleft Sentences**

A cleft sentence splits a simple sentence to emphasize a particular part.

**Example:**
- Standard: She bought a car.
- Cleft: It was a car that she bought.

**Drawing Trees for Cleft Sentences:**

Let's analyze the sentence "It was a car that she bought."

```
               S
              / \
            NP   VP
            |    / \
           Pro  V  S
           |   |   / \
          It  was NP  VP
                 |   / \
                Det  N  RelClause
                |    |    \
               a   car   Pro
                         that VP
                            / \
                          V   NP
                         |    |
                        bought Pro
                               |
                              she
```
