### Chapter 8: Conjunctions and Sentence Combining

In this chapter, we will explore conjunctions and how they are used to combine sentences. Understanding how conjunctions function within sentences and how they help in constructing compound and complex sentences is crucial for analyzing complex syntactic structures. We'll examine coordinating, subordinating, and correlative conjunctions and provide practice exercises to reinforce your understanding.

#### 8.1 Coordinating Conjunctions

Coordinating conjunctions connect words, phrases, or independent clauses that are of equal syntactic importance. The most common coordinating conjunctions can be remembered using the acronym FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so.

**Examples:**
1. She likes tea and coffee.
2. He is tired, but he keeps working.
3. They can stay or leave.

**Drawing Trees with Coordinating Conjunctions:**

Let's analyze the sentence "She likes tea and coffee."

```
          S
         / \
        NP  VP
        |   / \
       Pro  V  NP
        |   |   \
       She likes  NP
                /  \
              N    Conj N
             /     |   \
            tea    and coffee
```

- **S**: The entire sentence.
- **NP**: Noun phrase (She).
  - **Pro**: Pronoun (She).
- **VP**: Verb phrase (likes tea and coffee).
  - **V**: Verb (likes).
  - **NP**: Noun phrase (tea and coffee).
    - **N**: Noun (tea).
    - **Conj**: Conjunction (and).
    - **N**: Noun (coffee).

#### 8.2 Subordinating Conjunctions

Subordinating conjunctions connect an independent clause with a dependent clause. They introduce subordinate clauses and show the relationship between the two clauses.

**Examples:**
1. She stayed home because it was raining.
2. Although he was tired, he went to work.
3. I will go if you come with me.

**Drawing Trees with Subordinating Conjunctions:**

Let's analyze the sentence "She stayed home because it was raining."

```
           S
          / \
        NP   VP
        |    / \
       Pro  V  NP  SBAR
        |   |   |     \
       She stayed home  S
                        / \
                      Conj  S
                      |     \
                   because  NP  VP
                            |   / \
                           Pro  V  AdjP
                            |   |   \
                           it  was  raining
```

- **NP**: Noun phrase (She).
  - **Pro**: Pronoun (She).
- **VP**: Verb phrase (stayed home because it was raining).

    - **Conj**: Conjunction (because).
    - **S**: Sentence (it was raining).
      - **NP**: Noun phrase (it).
        - **Pro**: Pronoun (it).
      - **VP**: Verb phrase (was raining).
        - **V**: Verb (was).
        - **AdjP**: Adjective phrase (raining).
          - **Adj**: Adjective (raining).

#### 8.3 Correlative Conjunctions

Correlative conjunctions work in pairs to join words, phrases, or clauses that are of equal importance. Common correlative conjunctions include either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also.

**Examples:**
1. Either you come, or I will go.
2. She likes both tea and coffee.
3. Not only is he talented, but he is also hardworking.

**Drawing Trees with Correlative Conjunctions:**

Let's analyze the sentence "Either you come, or I will go."

```
          S
         / | \
    Correl  S  Correl
     /    / \   \
  Either  NP  VP   or  S
            |   / \    \
           Pro  V   Correl  S
            |   |      \   / \
           you  come   I  VP
                            |
                            V
                            |
                            go
```

  - **NP**: Noun phrase (I).
    - **Pro**: Pronoun (I).
  - **VP**: Verb phrase (will go).
    - **V**: Verb (go).

#### 8.4 Combining Sentences with Conjunctions

Understanding how to combine sentences using conjunctions is essential for constructing complex and compound sentences.

**Examples:**
1. I was hungry, so I made a sandwich.
2. She sings beautifully, and she plays the piano.
3. He went to the store because he needed milk.
