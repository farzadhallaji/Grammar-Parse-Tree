### Chapter 2: Basic Sentence Structures

In this chapter, we will explore the basic structures of simple, compound, and complex sentences. Understanding these fundamental structures is crucial before moving on to more advanced syntactic trees. We'll begin with the simplest sentences and gradually add complexity.

#### 2.1 Simple Sentences

A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause with a subject and a predicate. The predicate typically includes a verb and may include objects and modifiers.

**Components of Simple Sentences:**
- **Subject**: The doer of the action or the topic of the sentence.
- **Verb**: The action or state of being.
- **Object**: The receiver of the action (if there is one).

**Examples:**
1. The cat sleeps.
2. She reads books.
3. They are happy.

**Drawing Simple Syntactic Trees:**

Let's analyze the sentence "The cat sleeps."

```
        S
       / \
      NP  VP
     /   /  \
   Det  N    V
   |   |    |
  The  cat  sleeps
```

- **S**: The entire sentence.
- **NP**: The noun phrase (The cat).
  - **Det**: Determiner (The).
  - **N**: Noun (cat).
- **VP**: The verb phrase (sleeps).
  - **V**: Verb (sleeps).

#### 2.2 Compound Sentences

A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so).

**Components of Compound Sentences:**
- **Independent Clauses**: Complete sentences that can stand alone.
- **Coordinating Conjunction**: Connects the independent clauses.

**Examples:**
1. The cat sleeps, and the dog barks.
2. She reads books, but he watches TV.
3. They are happy, yet they feel anxious.

**Drawing Compound Syntactic Trees:**

Let's analyze the sentence "The cat sleeps, and the dog barks."

```
                 S
               / | \
              /  |  \
            S   Conj  S
           / \   |   / \
         NP  VP  and  NP  VP
        / \  |        / \   |
      Det  N  V      Det  N  V
      |   |  |      |   |  |
     The cat sleeps  the dog barks
```

- **S**: The entire sentence.
- **Conj**: Coordinating conjunction (and).
- Each **S** contains:
  - **NP**: Noun phrase.
    - **Det**: Determiner (The).
    - **N**: Noun (cat, dog).
  - **VP**: Verb phrase.
    - **V**: Verb (sleeps, barks).

#### 2.3 Complex Sentences

A complex sentence contains one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. Dependent clauses are introduced by subordinating conjunctions (because, although, since, unless, while, when, where, if).

**Components of Complex Sentences:**
- **Independent Clause**: A complete sentence that can stand alone.
- **Dependent Clause**: A clause that cannot stand alone and depends on the main clause.
- **Subordinating Conjunction**: Introduces the dependent clause.

**Examples:**
1. The cat sleeps because it is tired.
2. She reads books although she is busy.
3. They are happy when they are together.

**Drawing Complex Syntactic Trees:**

Let's analyze the sentence "The cat sleeps because it is tired."

```
                       S
                      / \
                    /    \
                   S      SBAR
                  / \      |
                NP   VP    S
               / \   |    / \
             Det  N  V   SB  VP
             |   |  |   |   / \
            The cat sleeps Pro  V  AdjP
                           |    |   |
                           it   is  Adj
                                     |
                                    tired
```

- **S**: The entire sentence.
- **SBAR**: Subordinate clause introduced by a subordinating conjunction.
- Main **S** contains:
  - **NP**: Noun phrase (The cat).
    - **Det**: Determiner (The).
    - **N**: Noun (cat).
  - **VP**: Verb phrase (sleeps).
    - **V**: Verb (sleeps).
- Subordinate **S**:
  - **SBAR**: Subordinate clause.
    - **S**: Subordinate clause introduced by the conjunction (because).
      - **Pro**: Pronoun (it).
      - **VP**: Verb phrase (is tired).
        - **V**: Verb (is).
        - **AdjP**: Adjective phrase (tired).
          - **Adj**: Adjective (tired).
