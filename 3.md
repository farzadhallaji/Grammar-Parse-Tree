### Chapter 3: Noun Phrases (NP)

In this chapter, we will explore noun phrases (NP) in greater detail. Understanding how noun phrases are constructed and how they function within sentences is essential for analyzing more complex syntactic structures. We'll examine simple noun phrases, complex noun phrases, and provide practice exercises to reinforce your understanding.

#### 3.1 Simple Noun Phrases

A simple noun phrase (NP) consists of a noun and any determiners or modifiers that accompany it. The noun is the head of the phrase, and the determiners and modifiers provide additional information about the noun.

**Components of Simple Noun Phrases:**
- **Head Noun**: The main noun in the phrase.
- **Determiners (Det)**: Articles (a, an, the), demonstratives (this, that), possessives (my, your), quantifiers (some, many).
- **Adjectives (Adj)**: Words that describe the noun (big, red).

**Examples:**
1. The cat
2. A book
3. My friend

**Drawing Simple Noun Phrase Trees:**

Let's analyze the noun phrase "The big cat."

```
     NP
    / | \
  Det  Adj  N
   |    |   |
  The  big  cat
```

1. My friend, John, is coming over.
2. The book, a bestseller, was thrilling.

**Drawing Appositive Noun Phrase Trees:**

Let's analyze the noun phrase "My friend, John."

```

**Examples:**
1. The cat that is sleeping
2. The book, which I read, was amazing.

**Drawing Noun Phrase Trees with Relative Clauses:**

Let's analyze the noun phrase "The cat that is sleeping."

```
       NP
     / | \
   Det  N  RelClause
   |   |   / \

2. A picture of the mountains

**Drawing Noun Phrase Trees with Prepositional Phrases:**

Let's analyze the noun phrase "The book on the table."

```
        NP
      / | \
    Det  N  PP
    |   |   \
   The book  P
