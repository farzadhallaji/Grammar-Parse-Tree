### Chapter 5: Prepositional Phrases (PP)

In this chapter, we will explore prepositional phrases (PP) in greater detail. Understanding how prepositional phrases are constructed and how they function within sentences is crucial for analyzing complex syntactic structures. We'll examine simple prepositional phrases, complex prepositional phrases, and provide practice exercises to reinforce your understanding.

#### 5.1 Simple Prepositional Phrases

A simple prepositional phrase (PP) consists of a preposition and its object, which can be a noun phrase (NP). Prepositional phrases function as modifiers, providing additional information about time, location, direction, or other relationships.

**Components of Simple Prepositional Phrases:**
- **Preposition (P)**: A word indicating the relationship between its object and another word (on, in, at, by).
- **Object of the Preposition (NP)**: A noun phrase that follows the preposition (the table).

**Examples:**
1. On the table
2. In the room
3. At the park

**Drawing Simple Prepositional Phrase Trees:**

Let's analyze the prepositional phrase "On the table."

```
      PP
     /  \
    P    NP
    |   /  \
   on  Det  N
        |   |
       the table
```

#### 5.2 Prepositional Phrases as Modifiers

Prepositional phrases often function as modifiers, providing additional information about nouns, verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They can function as adjectival phrases (modifying nouns) or adverbial phrases (modifying verbs, adjectives, or adverbs).

**Examples:**
1. The book on the table (modifying a noun)
2. She runs in the park (modifying a verb)
3. Happy with the results (modifying an adjective)

**Drawing Trees with Prepositional Phrases as Modifiers:**

      |   / \
      Pro  VP  PP
       |   |   /  \
      She  V  P    NP
           |   |   / \
          runs in  Det  N
