 ### Chapter 7: Pronouns and Determiners (Pro and Det)

In this chapter, we will explore pronouns (Pro) and determiners (Det) in greater detail. Understanding how these elements function within sentences is essential for analyzing complex syntactic structures. We'll examine different types of pronouns and determiners, and provide practice exercises to reinforce your understanding.

#### 7.1 Pronouns (Pro)

A pronoun (Pro) is a word that substitutes for a noun or noun phrase. Pronouns help avoid repetition and make sentences less cumbersome. 

**Types of Pronouns:**
- **Subject Pronouns**: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
- **Object Pronouns**: me, you, him, her, it, us, them
- **Possessive Pronouns**: mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs
- **Reflexive Pronouns**: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves
- **Relative Pronouns**: who, whom, whose, which, that
- **Demonstrative Pronouns**: this, that, these, those
- **Indefinite Pronouns**: someone, anyone, everyone, nobody, each

**Examples:**
1. She is reading.
2. They saw him.
3. This is mine.
4. He helped himself.
5. The book that you gave me.

**Drawing Simple Pronoun Trees:**

Let's analyze the sentence "She is reading."

```
      S
     / \
    NP  VP
    |   |
   Pro  V
    |   |
   She is reading
```

- **S**: The entire sentence.
- **NP**: Noun phrase (She).
  - **Pro**: Pronoun (She).
- **VP**: Verb phrase (is reading).
  - **V**: Verb (is reading).

#### 7.2 Possessive Pronouns and Reflexive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns show ownership, and reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of the sentence.

**Examples:**
1. This book is mine.
2. She did it herself.

**Drawing Trees with Possessive and Reflexive Pronouns:**

Let's analyze the sentence "This book is mine."

```
      S
     / \
    NP  VP
   / \   \
 Det  N   VP
 |    |   |
This book  V  NP
            |  |
           is Pro
               |
              mine
```

Let's analyze the sentence "She did it herself."

```
       S
     /  \
    NP   VP
    |   /  \
   Pro  V   NP
    |   |   |
   She did Pro
            |
           it
          AdvP
           |
         Pro
           |
       herself
```

#### 7.3 Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses that provide more information about a noun. They are used to connect clauses or phrases to a noun or pronoun.

**Examples:**
1. The person who called me.
2. The book that you gave me.

**Drawing Trees with Relative Pronouns:**

Let's analyze the noun phrase "The person who called me."

```
          NP
       /  |  \
     Det   N  RelClause
     |    |      \
    The person   Pro
                 who
                 VP
                 / \
               V   NP
              |    |
            called Pro
                   |
                   me
```

#### 7.4 Demonstrative and Indefinite Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns point to specific things, while indefinite pronouns refer to non-specific things.

**Examples:**
1. This is mine.
2. Someone is here.

**Drawing Trees with Demonstrative and Indefinite Pronouns:**

Let's analyze the sentence "This is mine."

```
      S
     / \
    NP  VP
    |   |
   Pro  V
    |   |
   This is Pro
            |
           mine
```

Let's analyze the sentence "Someone is here."

```
      S
     / \
    NP  VP
    |   |
   Pro  V
    |   |
Someone is Adv
           |
          here
```

#### 7.5 Determiners (Det)

A determiner (Det) is a word placed in front of a noun to specify quantity, definiteness, possession, or other aspects. Determiners include articles, demonstratives, possessives, quantifiers, numbers, and distributives.

**Types of Determiners:**
- **Articles**: a, an, the
- **Demonstratives**: this, that, these, those
- **Possessives**: my, your, his, her, its, our, their
- **Quantifiers**: some, any, many, much, few, several, all, both
- **Numbers**: one, two, three, etc.
- **Distributives**: each, every, either, neither

**Examples:**
1. The cat
2. Some books
3. My friend

**Drawing Simple Determiner Trees:**

Let's analyze the noun phrase "The cat."

```
      NP
     /  \
   Det   N
   |    |
  The   cat
```

#### 7.6 Determiners with Adjective Phrases

Determiners can work together with adjective phrases to provide more descriptive information about the noun.

**Examples:**
1. The big red balloon
2. Some interesting books

**Drawing Trees with Determiners and Adjective Phrases:**

Let's analyze the noun phrase "The big red balloon."

```
       NP
     /  |  \
   Det   AdjP  N
   |    / |  \
  The  Adj Adj  |
       |   |    |
      big  red  balloon
```
