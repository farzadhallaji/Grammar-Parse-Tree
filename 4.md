### Chapter 4: Verb Phrases (VP)

In this chapter, we will delve into verb phrases (VP) in greater detail. Understanding how verb phrases are constructed and how they function within sentences is crucial for analyzing complex syntactic structures. We'll examine simple verb phrases, complex verb phrases, and provide practice exercises to reinforce your understanding.

#### 4.1 Simple Verb Phrases

A simple verb phrase (VP) consists of a verb and any objects or complements that accompany it. The verb is the head of the phrase, and the objects and complements provide additional information about the action or state.

**Components of Simple Verb Phrases:**
- **Main Verb**: The central action or state (run, read, is).
- **Direct Object**: The noun phrase receiving the action (a book).
- **Indirect Object**: The noun phrase indirectly affected by the action (to him).

**Examples:**
1. She runs.
2. He reads a book.
3. They are happy.
