### Chapter 9: Advanced Sentence Structures

In this chapter, we will explore advanced sentence structures, including relative clauses, conditional sentences, and embedded sentences. Understanding these complex structures and how they function within sentences is essential for analyzing intricate syntactic forms. We will examine these structures in detail and provide practice exercises to reinforce your understanding.

#### 9.1 Relative Clauses

Relative clauses provide additional information about a noun and begin with relative pronouns such as who, whom, whose, which, and that. They can be essential (defining) or non-essential (non-defining).

**Examples:**
1. The person who called me is my friend. (Defining)
2. The book, which I read, was amazing. (Non-defining)

**Drawing Trees with Relative Clauses:**

Let's analyze the sentence "The person who called me is my friend."

```
                   S
                  / \
                NP   VP
              / | \    \
           Det  N  RelClause V  NP
           |    |       \    |    \
          The person   Pro  is  NP
                        who     Det  N
                               |   |
                            called me
                              my  friend
```

- **S**: The entire sentence.
- **NP**: Noun phrase (The person who called me).
  - **Det**: Determiner (The).
  - **N**: Noun (person).
  - **RelClause**: Relative clause (who called me).
    - **Pro**: Pronoun (who).
    - **VP**: Verb phrase (called me).
      - **V**: Verb (called).
      - **NP**: Noun phrase (me).
        - **Pro**: Pronoun (me).
- **VP**: Verb phrase (is my friend).
  - **V**: Verb (is).
  - **NP**: Noun phrase (my friend).
    - **Det**: Determiner (my).
    - **N**: Noun (friend).

#### 9.2 Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences express hypothetical situations and their consequences. They often contain if-clauses (conditions) and main clauses (results). 

**Types of Conditional Sentences:**
- **Real Conditionals**: Situations that are real or possible (e.g., If it rains, we will stay home).
- **Unreal Conditionals**: Hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situations (e.g., If I were you, I would go).

**Examples:**
1. If it rains, we will stay home. (Real conditional)
2. If I were you, I would go. (Unreal conditional)

**Drawing Trees for Conditional Sentences:**

Let's analyze the sentence "If it rains, we will stay home."

```
             S
            / \
          SBAR  S
           |    / \
          S    NP  VP
         / \   |   / \
      Conj  S Pro Aux  VP
      |     \ |   |    \
     If     NP  V   NP
            |   \   \
           Pro  rains V  NP
            |          |   \
           it        stay home
```

- **S**: The entire sentence.
- **SBAR**: Subordinate clause (If it rains).
  - **Conj**: Conjunction (If).
  - **S**: Sentence (it rains).
    - **NP**: Noun phrase (it).
      - **Pro**: Pronoun (it).
    - **VP**: Verb phrase (rains).
      - **V**: Verb (rains).
- **S**: Main clause (we will stay home).
  - **NP**: Noun phrase (we).
    - **Pro**: Pronoun (we).
  - **VP**: Verb phrase (will stay home).
    - **Aux**: Auxiliary verb (will).
    - **V**: Verb (stay).
    - **NP**: Noun phrase (home).

#### 9.3 Embedded Sentences

Embedded sentences are clauses contained within another clause, often functioning as subjects, objects, or complements.

**Examples:**
1. I know that he is coming. (Object clause)
2. What she said surprised me. (Subject clause)
3. The fact that she is leaving is sad. (Complement clause)

**Drawing Trees for Embedded Sentences:**

Let's analyze the sentence "I know that he is coming."

```
               S
              / \
            NP   VP
            |    / \
           Pro  V  SBAR
            |   |   \
            I  know  S
                     / \
                   Conj  S
                   |     \
                 that   NP  VP
                        |   / \
                       Pro  Aux V
                        |    |  |
                       he    is coming
```

  - **Pro**: Pronoun (I).
- **VP**: Verb phrase (know that he is coming).
  - **V**: Verb (know).
  - **SBAR**: Subordinate clause (that he is coming).
    - **Conj**: Conjunction (that).
    - **S**: Sentence (he is coming).
      - **NP**: Noun phrase (he).
        - **Pro**: Pronoun (he).
      - **VP**: Verb phrase (is coming).
